This is an IRC bot, which is designed to execute Perl 6 commands from IRC, and
echo the output on IRC again.

Might also work for other languages :-)

To add a new execution target, conduct the following steps:

 * build it on the server
 * write a script that updates the repo and rebuilds. Store it in the evalbot
   repo under build-scripts/rebuild-<targetname>.sh or .pl
 * add a cron job for regular rebuilding (crontab -e)
 * add the target to %impls in evalbot.pl
 * push everything
 * pull on the server
 * restart evalbot
 * PROFIT
